# Basic Programming Principles Project
This project was implemented for the course "Basic Programming Principles", while I was studying at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

Project Grade: 10/10

Course Final Grade: 8.9/10


The code of this project is written fully in C programming language.

The project itself consisted of three parts, each one adding another feature to the whole. This repo shows the final version (completion) of the project.

Each .pdf file contains the description of each part of the project.

The folder of the Test Cases is given and contains the provided test cases for each part, which can be used as input or output, depending on their title.

The folder "Project21-22" contains the implementation of the code in C language. The IDE I used was CodeBlocks. The .cbp file, if executed, will open the whole C project in your default IDE.
