# Basic Programming Principles Project 2022-2023
This project was implemented for the course "Basic Programming Principles", while I was studying at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

Project Grade: 10/10

Final Course Grade: 8.9/10


The code of this project is written fully in C programming language.

The project itself consisted of three parts, each one adding another feature to the whole. This repo shows the final version (completion) of the project.
